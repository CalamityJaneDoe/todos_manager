# vue_todos

## Areas of improvment (Tech)
* Implement tests with `Playwright` or `Cypress`
* Refactor some components : they could be smaller
* Uniform code between composition/option Vue.JS' style (I've experimented both since this is a demo oriented project)
* `Pinia` is quite overkill for so few components (I've experimented since this is a demo oriented project)

## Areas of improvment (Feature)
* Add a chip "urgent" to the todo card whenever the todo is tagged "urgent"
* Add some charts to the stats page, using `chart.JS`, for example
* Add a due date picker and track creation and completion date (for stats purpose)
